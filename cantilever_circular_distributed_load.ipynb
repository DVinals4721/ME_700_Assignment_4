    "# 3D Cantilever Beam with Distributed Circular Force\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code simulates a 3D cantilever beam subjected to a distributed force applied in a circular pattern on one end. It uses nonlinear hyperelastic material modeling and demonstrates both the finite element solution process and 3D visualization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometry and Mesh\n",
    "- **Beam dimensions**: 20 × 1 × 1 (length × width × height)\n",
    "- **Mesh**: 20 × 4 × 4 hexahedral elements\n",
    "- The beam is fixed at the left end (x=0) and loaded at the right end\n",
    "\n",
    "### Material Properties\n",
    "- **Model**: Neo-Hookean hyperelastic solid\n",
    "- **Young's modulus**: 10,000\n",
    "- **Poisson's ratio**: 0.3\n",
    "- Linear elements for displacement field (\"Lagrange\", 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physics: Nonlinear Elasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implements a compressible Neo-Hookean material model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kinematics**: Defines deformation gradient $F = I + \\nabla u$\n",
    "2. **Strain measures**: Right Cauchy-Green tensor $C = F^T F$ and its invariants\n",
    "3. **Stored energy**: $\\psi = \\frac{\\mu}{2}(I_1-3) - \\mu \\ln J + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(\\ln J)^2$\n",
    "4. **Stress**: First Piola-Kirchhoff stress $P = \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial F}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This nonlinear material model accurately captures large deformations that linear elasticity cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The code applies a circular distributed force at the right end of the beam:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Location**: Centered at beam's right end\n",
    "- **Distribution**: Smooth circular pattern with radius 0.8\n",
    "- **Direction**: Downward in z-direction\n",
    "- **Magnitude**: Scaled gradually to promote convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The force is implemented as a UFL expression with a spatial distribution function that:\n",
    "1. Identifies points near the right end of the beam\n",
    "2. Creates a smooth cosine-based distribution within the circular region\n",
    "3. Applies force vectors in the specified direction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution uses an incremental Newton-Raphson method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem formulation**: Nonlinear variational problem based on the principle of virtual work\n",
    "2. **Solver configuration**:\n",
    "   - Newton's method with relaxed tolerances (1e-6)\n",
    "   - LU direct solver for linear systems\n",
    "   - Line search for better convergence\n",
    "   - 50 maximum iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loading strategy**:\n",
    "   - Force is applied incrementally over 50 steps\n",
    "   - Each step increases the force magnitude\n",
    "   - This incremental approach helps manage nonlinearities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The code creates an animated visualization of the beam deformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beam**: Shown as a warped mesh colored by displacement magnitude\n",
    "- **Force**: Visualized with red disk and blue cones\n",
    "- **Camera**: Positioned to provide a good view of the deformation\n",
    "- **Output**: Saved as an animated GIF showing progressive deformation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation demonstrates:\n",
    "- Handling of geometric and material nonlinearities\n",
    "- Distributed force application in FEA\n",
    "- Effective visualization of 3D structural behavior\n",
    "- Solver strategies for nonlinear convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting animation shows how the beam gradually deforms under the applied circular force, with the deflection increasing as the load is incrementally applied."
